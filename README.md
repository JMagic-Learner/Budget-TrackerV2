## Description
Hello, my name is Jason Ma. This application is called Budget Tracker.
              
Description:
This application helps users track their budget via both online and offline resources such as MongoDB and IndexDb.             
          
Coding Process
Using the base code from UWBootcamp, we add functionality for offline usage and coding. The key is reading IndexDB, and saving the values to IndexDb. We had to go through a step by step process of declaring what is the request from the indexDB etc.
